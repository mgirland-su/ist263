<h1>My Inner Thoughts & Feelings</h1>
<h2>Red Wine in a Hotel Room</h2>
<p>Red wine dripped on to his collar,<br>
    Seeping into the sheets and drying in the cracks of her palms,<br>
    Decorating the linens like rose petals. <br> <br>
    
    He often finds himself in lonely, crowded hotels <br>
    In the rooms of another and another and another <br>
    Endlessly creating and destroying and leaving by morning.<br><br>
    
    But she is alone most nights.<br>
    Playing a balancing game of too much yet not enough.<br>
    Twisting and reaching and making it to morning.<br><br>
    
    Some weeks hold hazy days of delicate touches,<br>
    Finding fingers to hold on to in messy nights, even if only for a moment.<br><br>
    
    Because for just a moment, she isn't alone.<br>
    Then, she can tell her secrets, whispered between breaths against his lips.<br><br>
    </p>

<p>Tonight, he looked up at her as if an angel sat before him,<br>
    With her wings strewn to the side.<br>
    Every answer he sought out, <br>
    Every wandering night looking for the constellations and a sign from God, <br>
    Was found between her legs.<br><br>
                    
    Moans echoed throughout the gaudy hotel room,<br>
    Or maybe they were screams.<br>
    You can't tell when your head's full of laughter<br>
    And your stomach's full of butterflies.<br><br>
                            
    Her eyes wandered to the skyline.<br>
    Top floor. She knew he would love the view.<br> 
    A beautiful place for beautiful things to happen before it, <br>
    For the details written in the morning must preserve some magic of it all.  <br><br>
    
    He was begging for more,<br>
    Or maybe for less.<br>
    You can't tell when your hands are a little busy <br>
    And you're having this much fun.<br><br>
                            
    One hand closed around his neck<br>
    While the other gripped the handle tighter.<br>
    Hands messily finding his torso, leaving shaky lines of red welts. <br>
    Scratching through his back as if to somehow break through. <br>
    Each layer of skin must hold some secret, some answer, beneath. <br><br>
    
    Past his spine and through his lungs, a gushing, beating heart. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>Scraping down his sides, <br>
        Tracing each vertebra on the pass upwards, <br>
        Kissing collar bones goodbye<br>
        For once, she got to be on top.<br>
        She got to finish first.<br><br>
                                
        Red wine bloomed through his chest<br>
        Down his back and across his pants.<br>
        Bottles and bottles saturating the silk sheets, <br>
        Running down her bare legs and drying in the cracks of her palms<br><br>
        
        He would have hated the sight<br>
        Would have hated the mess of it all<br>
        What was once clean and pristine, <br>
        Strategically laundered and prepared for the two,<br>
        Was now her final performance. <br><br>
        
        For the last trick up her sleeve <br>
        Or perhaps hidden in the folds of her wings,<br>
        Is her final act.<br>
        To make a man disappear. <br>
