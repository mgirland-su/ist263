            <h2>S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications: Class of 2024</h2>
            <h3>Digital Advertising and Marketing Minor</h3>    
            <p id="intropara">I have a passion for communicating, whether that be through words or graphic imagery, ideation or fantasizing; creatively or strategically. Ever since I was a little girl, the world of makeup and beauty absolutely enamored me. The idea of translating a way of living, a set of ideals, and habitual self care into product packaging has made me more than just a sucker for packaging. One day I will work for one of my favorite luxury makeup or skincare companies, leading product innovations and branding identities that are good for our planet and make people feel good about themselves, just as it has done for me.</p></div>
